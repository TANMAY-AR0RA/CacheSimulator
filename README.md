# CacheSimulator

This is a Machine problem project for the Advanced Computer Architecture class.
Implemented a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator
and used it to compare the performance, area, and energy of different memory hierarchy
configurations, using a subset of the SPEC-2000 benchmark suite.
